This repository is created to keep track of [Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow?) provided by Coursera.

This educational program, I learned to process text, including tokenizing and representing sentences as vectors, so that they can be input to a neural network. also, I learned to using RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs in TensorFlow.
