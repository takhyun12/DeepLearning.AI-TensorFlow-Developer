This repository is created to keep track of [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction?) provided by Coursera.

This educational program, I learned how to build time series models in TensorFlow. I did first implement best practices to prepare time series data. I did also explore how RNNs and 1D ConvNets can be used for prediction.
