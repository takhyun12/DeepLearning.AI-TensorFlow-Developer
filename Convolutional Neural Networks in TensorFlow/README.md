Certificate of the course that is offered at Coursera and DeepLearing.AI.

#### Author: Tackhyun Jung

#### Status: Completed

This repository is created to keep track of [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow) provided by Coursera.

This educational program, I learned advanced techniques to improve the computer vision model I built in Course 1. I did explore how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout.
