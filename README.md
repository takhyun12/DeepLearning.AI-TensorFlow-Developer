# TensorFlow Developer Specialization with DeepLearning.AI

#### Author: Tackhyun Jung

#### Status: Completed

This repository is created to keep track of [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) provided by Coursera. This educational program is developed by `DeepLearning.AI` and designed to teaches you applied machine learning skills with TensorFlow so you can build and train powerful models. 

In this educational program, I got hands-on experience through 16 Python programming assignments.
